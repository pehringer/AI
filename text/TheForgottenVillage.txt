The Forgotten Village

In the remote highlands of Scotland, there existed a village that maps no longer marked, its name whispered only in legends—Eldrinvale. Shrouded in perpetual mist, the village seemed almost alive, cradled by towering pines and nestled beside a dark, shimmering lake. Few dared venture near it, and those who did rarely returned with memories intact.

Amara was not one for superstition. She was a historian, a seeker of truth. When she stumbled upon an old journal in her late grandfather’s attic, she felt an irresistible pull toward Eldrinvale. The journal’s brittle pages, filled with her grandfather’s neat handwriting, spoke of strange encounters—a village where time bent and history lay trapped in endless loops.

“Do not seek the vale,” he had written on the final page. “Its beauty hides a curse.”

Yet, the lure of the unknown was too great. Armed with a backpack, a notebook, and her trusty camera, Amara set out for the highlands on a crisp autumn morning. The journey was long and winding, the roads narrowing until they became little more than dirt paths. By evening, she found herself at the edge of a dense forest, the first hints of mist curling through the trees.

“Last stop, miss,” the taxi driver said, his thick accent tinged with unease. “No one goes further than this.”

Amara nodded, stepping out into the cool air. The forest was eerily quiet, save for the occasional rustle of leaves. She checked her map—one she had cobbled together from scraps of local lore and her grandfather’s notes—and began walking.

The deeper she ventured, the thicker the mist grew, wrapping around her like a living thing. Hours passed, and just as doubt began to creep in, she spotted it: a faint glow through the trees. Her heart quickened. Pushing forward, she emerged into a clearing, and there it was—Eldrinvale.

The village looked frozen in time. Cobblestone streets wound between quaint cottages with thatched roofs, their chimneys exhaling thin plumes of smoke. Lanterns hung from wooden posts, casting a warm amber light. Yet, something felt... off. The air was heavy, and the villagers—who moved about as if in a daze—barely seemed to notice her arrival.

“Excuse me,” Amara called to a woman carrying a basket of apples. The woman stopped, her expression blank.

“Welcome, traveler,” she said, her voice monotone. “Stay as long as you wish.”

Before Amara could reply, the woman walked away, leaving her with a strange unease. She wandered further, her eyes taking in every detail—the ancient church, the small marketplace, the fountain at the village center where water trickled from the mouth of a stone dragon.

As night fell, the village seemed to come alive in a different way. The mist thickened, swirling like ghostly tendrils, and an unnatural stillness settled over Eldrinvale. Amara found lodging in an old inn, where the innkeeper, an elderly man with a weathered face, offered her a room without question.

“Many come,” he said cryptically as he handed her a key. “Few leave.”

That night, Amara dreamed of her grandfather. In her dream, he stood by the lake, his face shadowed. “You must leave,” he said, his voice urgent. “The village is not what it seems.”

She woke with a start, the faint light of dawn seeping through her window. Determined to uncover the truth, she decided to explore the lake her grandfather had mentioned.

The lake was as breathtaking as it was ominous. Its surface was a perfect mirror, reflecting the towering pines and the pale morning sky. As Amara approached, she noticed something peculiar—a stone archway rising from the water, covered in moss and etched with strange symbols. The journal had mentioned this archway but offered no explanation.

A voice startled her. “The gate.”

She turned to see a man standing nearby. He was younger than most of the villagers, with piercing green eyes and an air of quiet intensity.

“It’s a gateway,” he continued. “To what, no one knows. But those who enter... never return.”

“Have you tried?” Amara asked, intrigued.

He shook his head. “I’m not a fool. My name is Callum, by the way.”

“Amara.”

Callum seemed different from the other villagers—aware, curious. Together, they examined the archway, but neither dared step through. As they talked, Amara learned that Callum was an outsider, like her. He had arrived in Eldrinvale years ago, drawn by the same inexplicable pull, and had been unable to leave ever since.

“The village holds you,” he said. “Like a fly in a web.”

Over the next few days, Amara and Callum grew close. Together, they pieced together fragments of the village’s history, gathering clues from old books, forgotten murals, and whispered tales. They learned of a curse placed upon Eldrinvale centuries ago, a punishment for a betrayal long buried in time. The archway, it seemed, was the key.

“Maybe the only way out,” Callum said one evening as they sat by the inn’s fireplace.

“But at what cost?” Amara wondered aloud.

That night, the mist grew thicker than ever, seeping into the inn through cracks in the windows and doors. Amara woke to the sound of whispers—soft, insistent, calling her to the lake. She grabbed her coat and crept outside, where she found Callum waiting.

“You heard it too,” he said.

They made their way to the lake, where the archway loomed in the moonlight. The water beneath it churned, glowing faintly. Without a word, they stepped closer, the whispers growing louder. Amara felt a strange pull, as if invisible hands were urging her forward.

“Wait,” Callum said, grabbing her arm. “We don’t know what’s on the other side.”

“We can’t stay here,” she replied, her voice firm. “Whatever’s beyond this, it has to be better than this... limbo.”

Callum hesitated, then nodded. Together, they stepped through the archway.

For a moment, there was nothing—no sound, no light, just an endless void. Then, a rush of sensations overwhelmed them. They were falling, spinning, their minds flooded with memories that weren’t their own. When they finally landed, it was on soft grass beneath a bright, open sky.

Amara sat up, her heart racing. They were no longer in Eldrinvale. Around them stretched rolling hills, dotted with wildflowers. In the distance, she could see a modern town, its buildings gleaming in the sunlight.

“We made it,” Callum said, his voice filled with wonder.

As they stood, Amara felt a pang of sadness. Eldrinvale, with all its mysteries and horrors, was behind them. But the curse was not something she could forget. She vowed to uncover the truth about the village’s past, to understand the forces that had trapped so many for so long.

For now, though, she and Callum were free. And that was enough.
